# This project is for class STAT6347 S18

## Project description
A set of transformed cryptocurrency's price is given so there is no way of knowing which one it is. The goal is to construct 60 days ahead forecast using the giving historical data.

## Criteria for the project results:
1. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for the predicted values. We try to find the smallest RMSE.
2. Calibration of the 95% prediction intervals. Your constructed 95% prediction intervals should on average contain a value as closest as possible to 95% of observations.
3. Sharpness of the 95% prediction intervals. If your 95% prediction intervals are generally calibrated, you also would like them to be shorter.
